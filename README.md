# Flux: Autonomous Support for the On-Chain World

Flux is a Web3-native, AI-powered customer support platform designed for the decentralized economy. We empower crypto organizations to deploy intelligent AI agents that resolve user queries with on-chain awareness and verifiable integrity.

# üö© **The Problem: Web2 Tools in a Web3 World**

Customer support in the crypto ecosystem is fundamentally broken. We are applying centralized, off-chain support models to decentralized, on-chain problems, leading to a crisis of trust, efficiency, and security.

**Lack of On-Chain Context**: Traditional support agents cannot read a block explorer, interpret on-chain actions, or diagnose transaction failures. They are blind to the source of truth.

**High Operational Costs & Slow Resolutions**: Scaling a 24/7 team of crypto-savvy human agents is prohibitively expensive and slow, leaving users frustrated.

**Centralized Security Risks**: Funneling user issues through Web2 helpdesks creates a massive surface area for phishing, social engineering, and data breaches. In an industry built on self-custody, this is an unacceptable risk.

**The core issue is a mismatch of paradigms**: Web3 operates on verifiable proof, while traditional support operates on "trust me."

# üß† **Knowledge Primer: The Flux Solution**

Flux bridges this gap by creating autonomous, on-chain-aware AI agents. Instead of creating support tickets, our agents create verifiable resolutions.

Our platform enables any organization (DeFi protocols, DAOs, NFT projects) to:

**Onboard Knowledge**: Train AI agents on their specific documentation, whitepapers, and URLs.

**Connect On-Chain Data**: Grant agents read-only access to block explorers, and other protocol-specific APIs.

**Authorize Safe Actions**: Empower agents to execute pre-approved, trust-minimized actions (e.g., refunds) through an enterprise-based AI agent with strict spending limits.

The result is a support experience that is instant, intelligent, and crypto-native. Users get accurate answers backed by on-chain data, and organizations reduce costs while enhancing security and user trust.

# üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features (MVP)**

## For Organizations (Admin Dashboard)

**Agent Deployment**: Spin up specialized agents instantly.

**Knowledge Base Management**: Upload and index PDFs, documentation, and specific URLs for Agent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

**Auditable Logs**: Immutable records of all customer chats and all agent-executed on-chain verification checks/transactions.

## For Customers (Widget/Chat)

**Instant Resolution**: Get answers and secure, instant on-chain actions directly from the agent.

# üöÄ **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to run the Flux application locally:

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 (for the Python backend)
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm (for the TypeScript backend and frontend)
- Git

## 1. Python Backend (Agents Service)

The Python backend handles AI agent management and runs on port 8000.

```bash
cd agents

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py
```

The Python backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## 2. TypeScript Backend (API Service)

The TypeScript backend provides the main API and runs on port 7990.

```bash
cd backend

pnpm install

pnpm run types

pnpm run dev
```

The TypeScript backend will be available at `http://localhost:7990`

## 3. Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is built with Next.js and runs on port 3000.

```bash
cd frontend

pnpm install

pnpm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in the respective directories with the required environment variables:

- **agents/.env**: Configure Python backend settings (API keys, database URLs)
- **backend/.env**: Configure TypeScript backend settings (Supabase credentials, JWT secrets)
- **frontend/.env.local**: Configure frontend settings (API endpoints)

## Production Build

For production deployment:

```bash
cd agents && python main.py

cd backend && pnpm run build && pnpm start

cd frontend && pnpm run build && pnpm start
```

# üöÄ **Hackathon Integrations**

We built Flux using cutting-edge decentralized infrastructure to maximize trust, scalability, and performance.

## 1. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI)

**Agent Architecture**: We utilize the uAgent framework to create resilient, conversational support agents.

**Structured Reasoning**: MeTTa is used for the agent's core logic, enabling secure, structured reasoning necessary for complex tasks like on-chain claim verification before a contract call is executed.

**Omni-Channel**: The use of uAgents allows support via both REST endpoints and native ASI Chat Protocol integration.

## 2. ENS

**Agent Identity**: Every deployed Flux agent is registered with a unique ENS subdomain (e.g., support.uniswap.eth, claims.dao.eth).

**Auditability**: Users and organizations can verify the authenticity and source of any agent-initiated transaction by checking the ENS name, making the platform fully trust-transparent.

## 3. Fluence

**DePIN Compute**: Our organisation based support AI agents (quantized for efficiency) run on Fluence Virtual Servers.

**Benefit**: This provides a decentralized, resilient, CPU-only compute solution, offering a low-cost, cloudless alternative to traditional centralized infrastructure.
