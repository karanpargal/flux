# Flux: Autonomous Support for the On-Chain World
Flux is a Web3-native, AI-powered customer support platform designed for the decentralized economy. We empower crypto organizations to deploy intelligent AI agents that resolve user queries with on-chain awareness and verifiable integrity.

## ðŸš© 1. The Problem: Web2 Tools in a Web3 World

Customer support in the crypto ecosystem is fundamentally broken. We are applying centralized, off-chain support models to decentralized, on-chain problems, leading to a crisis of trust, efficiency, and security.

**Lack of On-Chain Context**: Traditional support agents cannot read a block explorer, interpret smart contract states, or diagnose transaction failures. They are blind to the source of truth.

**High Operational Costs & Slow Resolutions**: Scaling a 24/7 team of crypto-savvy human agents is prohibitively expensive and slow, leaving users frustrated.

**Centralized Security Risks**: Funneling user issues through Web2 helpdesks creates a massive surface area for phishing, social engineering, and data breaches. In an industry built on self-custody, this is an unacceptable risk.

**The core issue is a mismatch of paradigms**: Web3 operates on verifiable proof, while traditional support operates on "trust me."
